title: Dark Mode
description: Implement and customize dark mode in your Principium UI application.
---

## Overview

Dark themes use the same system as light themes. The difference is the `mode` option on a theme:

- `mode: 'normal'` — shade scale runs from light (50) to dark (950)
- `mode: 'flipped'` — the scale is inverted for dark themes (50 becomes darkest, 950 lightest)

---

## Enable the `dark:` variant

Add this to your global CSS so Tailwind’s `dark:` variant works under a `.dark` class:

<SyntaxHighlighter
  showClipboard={false}
  className="bg-border"
  language="css"
  code={`@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));`}
/>

If you have multiple dark themes (e.g., `.dark`, `.coffee`), include them too:

<SyntaxHighlighter
  showClipboard={false}
  className="bg-border"
  language="css"
  code={`@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *, .coffee *));`}
/>

---

## Define one or many dark themes

Declare dark themes with `mode: 'flipped'`. You can define as many as you like.

<SyntaxHighlighter showClipboard={false} className="bg-border" language="ts" code={`// tailwind.config.ts
import {shadesPlugin} from '@principium/shades';

export default {
      plugins: [
            shadesPlugin({
                  defaults: true,
                  defaultTheme: 'light',
                  themes: {
                        light: {
                              // light theme (mode: 'normal' by default)
                        },
                        dark: {
                              mode: 'flipped',
                              colors: {
                                    background: {hue: 220, saturation: 15, lightness: 2, foreground: {lightness: 95}},
                                    ...restOfDarkColors,
                              },
                        },
                        coffee: {
                              mode: 'flipped',
                              colors: {
                                    background: {hue: 25, saturation: 12, lightness: 4, foreground: {lightness: 95}},
                                    ...restOfCoffeeColors,
                              },
                        },
                  },
            }),
      ],
};`} />

Note: When `defaults: true` and you extend the `dark` theme, your overrides are merged with Principium’s default dark theme. The theme’s `mode` remains inverted unless you supply `mode` yourself.

## Coffee dark theme example

Here’s a minimal coffee-flavored dark theme you can use:

<SyntaxHighlighter showClipboard={false} className="bg-border" language="ts" code={`// tailwind.config.ts
import {shadesPlugin} from '@principium/shades';

export default {
      plugins: [
            shadesPlugin({
                  themes: {
                        coffee: {
                              mode: 'flipped',
                              colors: {
                                    // Core
                                    background: {hue: 25, saturation: 10, lightness: 6, foreground: {lightness: 96}},
                                    card: {hue: 25, saturation: 10, lightness: 10},
                                    muted: {hue: 25, saturation: 10, lightness: 50, generateShades: false},

                                    // Brand
                                    primary: {hue: 25, saturation: 70, lightness: 52, foreground: {lightness: 98}},
                                    secondary: {hue: 35, saturation: 70, lightness: 52, foreground: {lightness: 10}},

                                    // State
                                    danger: {hue: 339, saturation: 90, lightness: 60, foreground: {lightness: 95}},
                                    success: {hue: 146, saturation: 90, lightness: 60, foreground: {lightness: 5}},
                                    warning: {hue: 37, saturation: 90, lightness: 60, foreground: {lightness: 5}},

                                    // Utility
                                    border: {hue: 25, saturation: 10, lightness: 18},
                                    ring: {hue: 25, saturation: 70, lightness: 52, generateShades: false},
                              },
                        },
                  },
            }),
      ],
};`} />

Apply it by adding the class to a high-level element (and include it in your `@custom-variant` rule if you want to use `dark:` with it):

<SyntaxHighlighter showClipboard={false} className="bg-border" language="tsx" code={`<html className="coffee">`} />

<div className="h-40" />
