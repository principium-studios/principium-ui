## What is Principium UI

**Principium UI** is a React component library built on top of **TailwindCSS** (v4). It combines the best of:

- **Radix-style API** familiar, composable props surface
- **HeroUI-inspired design** polished, production-ready look
- **Framer Motion** for performant, maintainable animations

## FAQ

### Do I need to install multiple packages ?

<div className="text-background-600">
The only package you need for the components to work is <code>@principium/theme</code>. This package not only provides the **tailwindcss plugin** that creates the styles for the components, but also the classes used in components for tailwind to be able to load onto the page.
</div>

### Can I apply Tailwind classes directly ?

<div className="text-background-600">
Absolutely. Since Principium UI uses the `@principium/variants` utility, the classes that you provide to the components will automatically be merged with the component's classes.
</div>

### Can I use Principium UI outside of React ?

<div className="text-background-600">
Our components are built on top of React hooks and patterns, making them work only in environments like React or Next.js. For other frameworks, there is no plan to support them.
</div>

### Why Framer Motion ?

<div className="text-background-600">
Instead of maintaining a custom animation library, we rely on Framer Motion for its robust, production-ready API and long-term maintainability. In the future, we plan to add animation based components like <code>Ticker</code>.
</div>
