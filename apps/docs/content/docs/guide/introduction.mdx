## What is Principium UI

**Principium UI** is a React component library built on top of **TailwindCSS** (v4). It combines the best of:

- **Radix-style API** familiar, composable props surface
- **HeroUI-inspired design** polished, production-ready look
- **Framer Motion** for performant, maintainable animations

## FAQ

### Do I need to install multiple packages

<div className="text-background-600">
If you want to have all the components in one package, you can install `@principium/react`. Otherwise, you can install each component separately. In both cases, the package `@principium/theme` is required for components to be styled correctly.
</div>

### Can I apply Tailwind classes directly

<div className="text-background-600">
Absolutely. Since Principium UI is driven by TailwindCSS v4 and uses the `@principium/variants` utility, you can layer your own utility classes on top of our components.
</div>

### Does Principium UI require runtime CSS

<div className="text-background-600">
No, all styles are generated at build time via TailwindCSS.
</div>

### Can I use Principium UI outside of React

<div className="text-background-600">
Our components leverage React hooks and patterns but work seamlessly in both React and Next.js applications. For other frameworks, like Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc., you can use another library üôè.
</div>

### Why Framer Motion

<div className="text-background-600">
Instead of maintaining a custom animation library, we rely on Framer Motion for its robust, production-ready API and longterm maintainability.
</div>
