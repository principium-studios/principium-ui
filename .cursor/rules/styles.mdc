## Variants

- Possible variants: solid, shadow, bordered, flat, faded, light, ghost
- Available colors: default, primary, secondary, success, warning, danger

## Base classes

- Base classes are defined in the colorVariants map in shared-utils
- Merge your classes using the cn utility from shared-utils rather than string concatenation

## Icons

- Use lucide-react for icons

## Colors

- All of the project colors are defined in principium.json. Based on this file, a theme.css file is generated. This theme.css file containts color shades for each provided color in the principium.json file.

### Ex: "primary" in principium.json will generate "primary-**number**" color in the theme.css file, where number is the number of the color shade (similar to tailwindcss color shades).

#### For a color in a theme that has "inverted" set to true, the color shades will be inverted.

- "primary-50" in the theme.css file will be the darkest shade of the primary color.
- "primary-950" in the theme.css file will be the lightest shade of the primary color.

#### For a color in a theme that has "inverted" set to false, the color shades will not be inverted.

- "primary-50" in the theme.css file will be the lightest shade of the primary color.
- "primary-950" in the theme.css file will be the darkest shade of the primary color.
