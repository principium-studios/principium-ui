## Accessibility

- All components must follow WAI-ARIA guidelines and best practices.
- Strive for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance or better.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where appropriate.
- Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support for all interactive elements.
- Accessibility is a first-class concern in design and implementation.
